                                   JAVASCRIPT
                                               
                                                             
1.Try creating one of each type of comment.

output:
//This is my first comment
/* I am interested in javascript*/


2.Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.

output:
var myName;


3.Assign the value 7 to variable a.
Assign the contents of a to variable b.

output:
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;
var a=7;
var b=a;
// Only change code below this line


4.Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.

output:
var a = 9;


5.Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

output:
// Only change code below this line
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a"
// Only change code above this line
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";


6.Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.

output:
// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;
// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

                           
7.Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.

output:
var sum = 10 + 10;

8.Change the 0 so the difference is 12.

output:
var difference = 45 - 33;

9.Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

output:
var product = 8 * 10;

10.Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.

output:
var quotient = 66 / 33;

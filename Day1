##Comment Your JavaScript Code                                                             
1.Try creating one of each type of comment.
```
//This is my first comment
/* I am interested in javascript*/
```

##Declare JavaScript Variables
2.Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.
```
var myName = "nithya"
console.log(myName)
```
output:
nithya

##Storing Values with the Assignment OperatorPassed
3.Assign the value 7 to variable a.
Assign the contents of a to variable b.
```
var a;
var b = 2;
var a=7;
var b=a;
console.log(b)
```
output:
7

##Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
4.Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.
```
var a = 9;
console.log(a)
```
output:
9

##Understanding Uninitialized Variables
5.Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.
```
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a"

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
```
output:
6
15
I am a String!

##Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
6.Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.
```
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```

## Add Two Numbers with JavaScript                          
7.Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.
```
var sum = 10 + 10;
console.log(sum)
```
output:
20

##Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScriptPassed
8.Change the 0 so the difference is 12.
```
var difference = 45 - 33;
console.log(difference)
```
output:
12

##Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
9.Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.
```
var product = 8 * 10;
console.log(product)
```
output:
80

##Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
10.Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.
```
var quotient = 66 / 33;
console.log(quotient)
```
output:
2

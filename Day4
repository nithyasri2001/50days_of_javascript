##Declare String Variables
21.Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
```
var myFirstName = 'Nithya';
var myLastName = 'D';
console.log(myFirstName) 
```
output:
Nithya

##Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
22.Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
```
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
console.log(myStr)
```
output:
I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

##Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
23.Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.
Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere.
You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.
```
var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
console.log(myStr)
```
output:
<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>

##Escape Sequences in Strings
24.You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. 
You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.
Here is the text with the escape sequences written out.
"FirstLinenewlinetabbackslashSecondLinenewlineThirdLine"
```
var myStr="FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";
```
output:
myStr: 
FirstLine
	\SecondLine
ThirdLine

##Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
25.Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.
```
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."  ;
console.log(myStr)
```
output:
This is the start. This is the end.
